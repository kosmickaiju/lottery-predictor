# Florida Scratch-Off Predictor/Ranker
This is a project that I have wanted to take on for a bit (heavily inspired by Jerry Selbee's cracking of Winfall), and I finally got around to it!
*Disclaimer: I did use some AI assistance for this project, especially for the API reverse engineering portion of the project - however, the design and debugging processes are entirely mine. This was more of a fun side project rather than a formal element of my professional portfolio, and I took this opportunity to learn more about APIs, data scraping, and data analysis.*
## How It Works
## How to Use
This project can be entirely run through your terminal, even without the use of the dashboard element. Simply run the following two commands once you're in the project directory (*likely your home directory*/*wherever you saved this directory*/lottery-predictor):
<br> *1. python scraper.py*
<br> *2. python analyze.py* <br>
Once you have run these two commands, open their respective CSV files - *florida_lottery_top_prizes.csv* and *ranked_scratch_offs.csv* - for the results!
